Another week, and I’m still [stacking chips][chips]. Last week’s
[chips][markers] looked like this:

[chips]: /2020/06/19/my-week-in-poker-chips
[markers]: /2020/08/22/my-weekchips-markers

<p class='image'><img src='https://mnf.m17s.net/$IMAGE_BASE.jpg' alt=''></p>

## Intention

At the start of the week, I wrote down NUMBER goals:

1. COMPLETED GOAL — ✅
1. PROGRESSED GOAL — ⏩
1. ABANDONED GOAL — ❌


## Update
