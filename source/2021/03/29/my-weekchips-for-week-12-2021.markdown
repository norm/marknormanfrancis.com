Another week, and I’m still
[stacking chips](/2020/06/19/my-week-in-poker-chips).
Last week’s [chips](/2020/08/22/my-weekchips-markers) looked like this:

## Reflection

In my [last update](/2021/03/22/my-weekchips-for-week-11-2021) I wrote:

Well, that didn't happen. Every time I started on 1970, and my brain just kind
of slid away from editing the data, so I allowed myself to do other things
rather than force myself to do something I obviously wasn't in the mood to do.

## Update

On Monday I fixed a little annoyance of mine in [Flourish][fl] where there was
an enforced requirement for some keys in the site configuration that were only
necessary if you were generating Atom feeds. Released a [new version][v094]
with this change and another fix.

I spent the rest of the body of the week editing together footage of me
playing Assassin's Creed II. I had to take a break after finishing the
play-through of Horizon Zero Dawn in February. Games are fun, right up until
you are playing through a section more than ten times in order to have it
appear exactly the way you want when including it in a video. Anyway, I
finished the editing so that it was ready in time to 
[release it on Youtube][ch1] for Friday's content and the second chapter
is ready for next week.

On Friday I started writing some python that could export as Markdown the
todos I keep in [Things][cct] for upcoming video content. But I dug myself
into a very deep rabbit hole of understanding the database format, and going
beyond the original brief into a full exporter. At the end of the day I
abandoned that project, for now.

Saturday morning I did something more productive, and finished up, committed,
and pushed some work I'd previously done on pulling into this site 
[my YouTube content][yt].

And Sunday morning I simply stayed in bed, which was nice.
