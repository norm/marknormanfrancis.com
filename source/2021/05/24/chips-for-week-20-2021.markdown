Another week, and I’m still [stacking chips][chips]. Last week’s
[chips][markers] looked like this:

## Intention

At the start of the week, I wrote down only one high level goal:

1. Eurovision — ✅


## Update

The first post-it note on my list of tasks for the week was "test tweeting
still works". So I started the week by trying to restore the python virtual
environment for my [Eurovision control panel][eurodrink] and discovering
that it was definitely now too old for me to get it working.

So I spent the week [rebuilding it][rebuild] from scratch, incorporating
some improvements I had been meaning to make for *several years now*.

I also watched two Eurovision semi-finals, repeat watched many of the
performances again on YouTube to make notes, made a couple of GIFs, and then
settled in on Saturday evening for the most frantic night of my year, four
hours of non-stop tweeting. There's no way I could do it and still get to
**watch** Eurovision without the control panel to do half the tweeting for me.
I spent days of my life automating those mere seconds, so I can concentrate
on the good part — shouting at the TV. [I love it.][jjdd]
