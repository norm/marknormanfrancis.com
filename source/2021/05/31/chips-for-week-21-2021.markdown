Another week, and I’m still [stacking chips][chips]. Last week’s
[chips][markers] looked like this:

## Intention

At the start of the week, I wrote down three high level goals:

1. Tidy up after Eurovision — ✅
1. Celebrate the end of the Horizon Zero Dawn series - ❌
1. Restore old content to site — ❌


## Update

During last week's rather breakneck reimplementation of the
[control panel][cp] for my [Eurovision Drinking Game][edg],
I did not take any time to commit the code as I went along. A bad habit I
have, as no matter how pressed for time I am it shouldn't take any time at all
to create point-in-time commits that I can then rewrite into a clean history
later. But I was feeling a little panicked that I wouldn't be ready, so I just
barrelled ahead writing code.

So, I spent the first couple of days taking that code and crafting a 
mostly-coherent history out of it, then [committing it][rebuild].

[cp]: https://github.com/norm/eurodrink
[edg]: https://eurovisiondrinking.com
[rebuild]: https://github.com/norm/eurodrink/compare/00142ac...7351b9c

Then I hit a midweek slump. After the rush to be ready for Eurovision,
Eurovision itself, and the cleanup that I wanted to get done before anything
about the code left my head, I felt rather drained of both energy and
motivation. So I spent the day playing Factorio, watching TV, and snoozing.

Thursday I still couldn't get started on anything, so instead I made some
[Police Squad! GIFs][gifs], more as an excuse to watch Police Squad! than
to have more GIFs really. And then I got side-tracked adding
[date-based navigation][dbn] with a random sampling of GIFs to the site.
Lastly, I started adding Atom feeds to each source and tag, but this turned
out to be more involved than I thought, so that can wait until next week.
