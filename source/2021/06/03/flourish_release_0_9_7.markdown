## 0.9.7 - 3 June 2021

#### New

  * Serve asset files (eg CSS, images, etc) from the source directory
    during live preview.
  * Raising `self.DoNotGenerate` in a generator will stop the current
    page from being generated, without causing any errors.

#### Other changes

  * Allow overriding an Atom feed's author and title values.

#### Bug fixes

  * Fix wildcard generation of URLs. Some patterns were not matching, for
    example `flourish generate /2021/?` was generating `/2021/index.html` but
    not `/2021/04/21/index.html`, or any source with a slug starting
    `/2021/...`.
  * Stop live preview caching sectile-generated templates, which invalidated
    the point of being able to live preview changes as they are made.
  * An Atom feed without entries will still generate now.
