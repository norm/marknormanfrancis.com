## 0.10.1 - 15 Jun 2021

#### New

  * Permanent (301) redirects from an old slug to a new location can be kept
    in the `_site.toml`:

        [permanent_redirects]
        "/index.php" = "/"

    and in an individual source:

        previous_slug = ['/page']


#### Bug fixes

  * Stop reusing previously generated files in the live preview.
  * Use backwards-compatible importlib_resources for older pythons, and
    test that part of the code.
