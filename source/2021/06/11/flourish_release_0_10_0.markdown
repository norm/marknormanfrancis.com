## 0.10.0 - 11 Jun 2021

Improvements to the blueprint (previously called "recipe") page.

#### New

  * Live preview adds a permanent icon in the top-right that can be used
    to toggle back and forth between rendered page and blueprint.
  * In the blueprint:
    * Edit/create/delete Sectile fragments directly in page.
    * List the full Sectile fragments search path.

#### Bug fixes

  * In the blueprint:
    * show all Sectile dimensions, not just the ones that are set
    * pretty print the context data
