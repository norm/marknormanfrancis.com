Changing the decor in my study a little, with some [`@hellocanvas`](https://twitter.com/hellocanvas) shapes

As well as a bunch of photos of friends and family, I also fancied including swatches of the colours of my website. And that has nothing to do with the fact I keep forgetting their names (as generated by Aurora for iOS), nosireebob. This one almost matches the wall it’s on.
