On Monday, chapter 54 of my Horizon Zero Dawn playthrough went live, and it contains one of my favourite sequences from the entire game (the first 16 minutes of the video). [`youtube.com/watch?v=xF2poD…`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF2poDHo0hA)

To celebrate this I've made a second behind-the-scenes video which explains the what and the why of a few of the edits I made when putting together this chapter. [`youtube.com/watch?v=t65w8t…`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t65w8tDQn-g)

(Essentially, it was an excuse to just go and watch it again, because I love it so.)
