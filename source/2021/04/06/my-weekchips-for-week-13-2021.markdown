Another week, and I’m still [stacking chips][chips]. Last week’s
[chips][markers] looked like this:

## Reflection

At the start of the week, I wrote my high-level goals down:

1. Increase [Ezio Collection content][ezio] buffer
2. Write up at least 1 thing about my video game series
3. Atom all the things
4. Improve the appearance of this site

I ticked off zero of these.

## Update

As the paltry stack of chips might illustrate, it wasn't a great week for
progress, or even for giving a damn about recording my chips. As I wrote when
describing the idea of [stacking chips][chips], any system for tracking my
time that becomes a burden I abandon. This week I had a bad week for
motivation, so I couldn't even maintain the effort of putting one chip in a
tube five times a day. But I don't punish myself for it. None of this is
mandatory, I do it because I want the record. So when I don't want to be
bothered, I don't do it and that's the right thing to do.

I did make some progress towards increasing my Ezio buffer. I got chapter 3
edited and finalised, apart from the music. I mostly record the music
separately from the voice and sound effects channels, and Assassin's Creed II
at least makes this somewhat easier by playing a lot of the music that's not
tied to a cinematic in a loop. Capture more than one full loop and you can
find the start and end, add it to the media bin, and have prepackaged music to
apply later. However, capturing loops of this current sequence is proving more
difficult as the game keeps swapping between tracks without getting a full
loop. And I got tired of replaying the same section for the fifth time.

I didn't write anything about making game videos, unless you count the above
paragraph.

I made a very small amount of progress towards adding Atom feeds to my things,
in that I made an SVG of the feed icon. I know these already exist, but I
wanted one that resembled the [older icon][old] that I prefer to the now widespread
icon, and I wanted to be able to reskin it in different colours easily. Plus I
was already in the mood to faff with SVG after [making myself a little
something][als].

I didn't improve the appearance of this site.

So what did I do, if not those things? Well, one thing I did was work on my
raw capture annotations. I formalised [a template][tmpl] for myself, so I can
more quickly find segments in the future (I spend too much time when editing
video trying to find *that bit* that I know I recorded, but can't remember
which file it is in) and then [annotated my raw footage][an] rather than
pretending I would do it later, as I have done for nearly half of my raw
Horizon Zero Dawn footage.

Otherwise, I did little else but stare into the middle distance. There are
some weeks where I just can't seem to concentrate on anything, and this was
one. So I did my default activity when my brain just slides off of everything
and made some more GIFs ([Ted Lasso][tl], [Pitch Meetings][pm]) and faffed
with that site's helper scripts.
