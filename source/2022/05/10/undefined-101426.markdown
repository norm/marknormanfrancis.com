Advance warning for the imminent demise of my favourite old pair of Bluetooth headphones. Despite working fine with my iMac theyâ€™ll connect to my M1 Mac but are no longer seen as an audio device by the newer hardware.

They have the best controls on them, with individual skip forward and backward buttons, a big activation button (the entire Sennheiser logo in the centre) for call accept/hangup/Siri and volume controls; very tactile and spatially located for ease of understanding.

Next track was the forward button, previous was the rearward button. Volume up was higher than volume down. No other headset has come close to them in terms of the human interface.

I shall miss you when I no longer have hardware that understands you can play music.
