Continuing the theme of 
[measuring my week in poker chips](/2020/06/19/my-week-in-poker-chips),
how did this week go?

Here’s my chips. The week started with a couple of days doing some coding
scraping and rescraping my [last.fm data](https://www.last.fm/user/mn_francis)
data, and trying to clean some of it up. Then the heat rolled in and I
couldn’t stand to sit in my study much so I just did other things.

Then today it has cooled just enough that with a fan going I could take the heat and actually think, so I’ve been playing with recipe publishing on my site. Ever wanted to make [the gumbo I bang on about](/recipes/chicken-and-chorizo-gumbo) so much? Today’s your lucky day!

But eventually the heat got to me so the last chip represents what I’m doing right now: sitting on the sofa, cold drink, no computer beyond this phone, and about to play on [my PlayStation](/tags/ps4share). An OK week considering.
