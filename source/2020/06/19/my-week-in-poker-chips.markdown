Recently I’ve been coding again. And it’s been quite gratifying after months
of just not feeling it. But also sometimes I find myself just sitting and
staring, or going FUUUUUCK and reading comics or watching tv instead. After
all, nobody’s expecting anything from me (well, apart from the cats) and I
have to take care of myself, first order of business is survival.

Nonetheless, having some energy to spend on long stalled personal projects is
nice while I still have all the time on my hands. But with the only real
marker of time passing being the two days when my wife isn’t sat in front of
her computer all day, I have been feeling a little … disconnected from time.

I needed a way to measure both the passing of the week, and wanted some way to
know what I’d been up to. It might feel like I’ve been sat in front of the
iMac for five days but also I’m sure I spent a day just playing Cities
Skylines? And I was sleeping too?

So I’ve divided the days of the week into five hour-fifteen-ish slots, with
breaks in between.

The idea being that as each slot comes to an end I make a note of what I was
doing. And then I can visualise that at the end of the week to see how my week
has been.

But I have to be mindful that I shouldn’t spend too much time on that part or
it’ll become a burden, I’ll abandon the idea and I will have learned nothing.
And still feel floaty.

My solution was to use a simple marker to summarise what I was doing. Not a
detailed log, just a single summary of “coding” or “reading”. Even if it’s not
100% true, it’ll do.

Here are my markers.

And here’s how my week went.

Two days of furious coding, released a new version of
[flourish](https://github.com/norm/flourish/releases/tag/v0.7). Took a day off
to read a bunch of comics and not be in front of a computer. Did some more
reading, some furious tidying, then some work towards organising my music
collection.

And today sketched a bit at my whiteboard, and started pulling in my
[last.fm history](https://www.last.fm/user/mn_francis) to integrate with
both my website and [my music library](https://github.com/norm/hornby/).
