Realised I didn’t do last week’s [#weekchips](/tags/weekchips/) as I go to post this week. Here’s a quick update with what I can remember (I don’t write notes down, but I do have the chips to remind me). 

The chips

Slow start to Monday, then a day and a half of putting more effort into learning both how to edit video and to effectively capture playing a game.

A midweek break, followed by a day where I finally cracked at tidied the cesspit my study had become, including removing all the bits of paper and other detritus I’d just pinned to the whiteboard instead of properly putting away.

Then Friday I did nothing. Well, nothing with computers anyway.

I could’ve probably written more detailed notes but it’s been a week and my brain just does not retain this kind of information any more. Which is some of the reason for making these notes I guess.
