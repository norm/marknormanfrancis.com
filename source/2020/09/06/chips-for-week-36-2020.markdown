This week’s [#weekchips](/tags/weekchips/). 

The week starts with the bank holiday, so just a bit of video editing in the morning before my wife got up and I go spend the day with her.

Tuesday adding two GitHub actions workflows to [`marknormanfrancis.com`](http://marknormanfrancis.com). One to auto-pull and generate entries for things I post to [`@norms_ps4`](https://twitter.com/norms_ps4), which then files them as a pull request. The other to generate and publish the site when the main branch is updated.

 This means I can edit and merge the PR and then publish the new entries on my site without touching a desktop computer. Which is nice.

Wednesday and Thursday I spent putting [`marknormanfrancis.com`](http://marknormanfrancis.com) and [`gifs.cackhanded.net`](http://gifs.cackhanded.net) behind Cloudfront so I can turn on HTTPS.

And Friday I spent doing more video editing, learning how to properly use media bins, adjustment clips, and overlays in Davinci Resolve.

After a month of being ill and then entirely unfocused it’s been nice to get back to spending days on deep technical dives.

My brain feels like it is working again.

Also, I cheated on the hard work I did last week removing stuff from my whiteboard and stuck a bit of paper back up again.
