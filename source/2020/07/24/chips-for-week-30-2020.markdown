Another week, another [stack of chips](/2020/06/19/my-week-in-poker-chips).
This week’s chips look like this:

I spent the start of the week working on integrating
[Sectile templating](https://github.com/norm/flourish/commit/c29b1688defaf9b876160a8f9999e4c7e606b8a8)
into [flourish](https://github.com/norm/flourish), 
and [implementing a “recipe” page](https://github.com/norm/flourish/commit/2f29b1c80da69c98ab2a5f46d8212aec31782d4d)
to help debug that.

This may be of interest to a handful of people with old Yahoo experience, but would be massively confusing to anyone else. Not helped by a complete lack of documentation, because right now I just can’t be bothered to write it.

But I want to use it and since to the best of my knowledge I am the only person using flourish, this isn’t a problem.

Eventually I’ll write some docs but that’s something I really have to be in the mood for. And this week I was not in that mood.

As can be seen in the stripe of white chips in the middle of the week I had a lie-in on Wednesday and did some general houseworky stuff instead to clear my brain. Then spent the rest of Wednesday [switching my site to use Sectile](https://github.com/norm/marknormanfrancis.com/commit/b2edf164d649ca2eef458ca42f94a030995c513f).

Thursday I cleaned up and committed the changes to flourish having found any bugs by converting my site. Then spent the afternoon reading because I couldn’t code any more. Some of that reading was prep for today though; I was researching how to make GIFs using FFmpeg.

A while ago I made a [GIFs site](http://gifs.cackhanded.net). Originally in Hugo, to learn that. Later converted to flourish as a second test case. But the gifs themselves were made with Gif Brewery. It’s a great program for casual GIF making but not for bulk.

Plus everything is a little too manual. Even if you save the state, changing fonts means essentially starting from scratch. That, times every GIF? Nope.

So now I have a script to make a GIF from a config file. And that config file will double as the source definition for a page in flourish. So making and publishing the GIF in one.

And to celebrate I remade [one of my favourite GIFs](http://gifs.cackhanded.net/invader-zim/not-now-son) and the whole reason I got into making them in the first place (because no-one else had and it’s just the best Invader Zim line). Ta-da!
