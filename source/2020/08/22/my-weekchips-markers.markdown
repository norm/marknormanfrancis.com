My markers for
[seeing how my week has gone](/2020/06/19/my-week-in-poker-chips).
Each colour represents a broad type of activity:

* **blue** represents coding, public or private
* **pink** represents creating something, which could be words to be
  published or taking, curating, editing, and publishing photos or video…
* **red** represents tidying, which could be physical items (my study is a
  broad pit of despair when it comes to clutter) or digital (I have **a lot**
  of "to sort" folders on my computers)
* **teal** represents reading, which could be a book, comic, news…
* **black** represents time spent organising my music library (see **red**, 
  I have a lot of stuff I've never added or categorised properly)
* **white** represents not doing anything useful; such as sleeping, being ill,
  watching TV…
