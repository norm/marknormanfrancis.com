Another week, but no [stack of chips](/2020/06/19/my-week-in-poker-chips).
This is the past week, summed up in one chip:

I spent the week still feeling pretty bad, topped up with the temperature meaning I wouldn’t spend time in my study, and couldn’t think straight even when I did. I’ve basically made a handful of gifs and tried my hand (badly) at video editing.

This week can get in the bin.
