Tidying my whiteboard as Iâ€™d been using it to keep paper and notes like some kind of todo list (the horror). I keep a lot of trinkets on there too, and just uncovered my favourite personal business card.

I loved that the colours in the logo were formed from my favourite works of art on the site. A nod to Dopplr, but also it made so much sense.

A small collection of some of my other favourite trinkets, including a [`@veronicadearly`](https://twitter.com/veronicadearly) motivational card and an original [`@apelad`](https://twitter.com/apelad) [`@HOBOTOPIA`](https://twitter.com/HOBOTOPIA) cartoon.
