Another week, and I’m still [stacking chips][chips]. Last week’s
[chips][markers] looked like this:

## Intention

At the start of the week, I wrote down these high level goals:

1. Increase Ezio content buffer — ✅
1. Finish restoring old content into site — ❌
1. Eurovision data — ❌

When I make my lists of goals for the week, I do tend to put them in
most-wanted through least-wanted order. But, as I have previously written,
I also don't find myself beholden to the list. These are things to fill my
time, not hard-and-fast requirements.

However, one reason the first goal was to increase the YouTube content buffer
was that I had no video to put out on the Friday.

## Update

When I started making and publishing the [Horizon Zero Dawn][hzd] videos, I
finished the first four, published two, and scheduled the next two for Monday
and Friday. And I have kept to that schedule, a new game video twice a week.
When I started the Assassin's Creed [Ezio series][ez], I scheduled the first
one to replace a Horizon video that Friday.

My plan was to run the two concurrently, build up a buffer, then when the
Horizon videos ran out (chapter 60 is the last of the storyline, and although
I have some extras I don't consider them mainline content) I would be able to
switch Ezio to two videos a week. Then I forgot I hadn't set the video to
autopublish, so the very second Friday of this new plan was without a video.

Over the past couple of weeks, I've had problems with how I capture video, and
of motivation of replaying the same content *for the tenth time* to recapture
it. No new videos got made, and I burned through what little buffer I had
built up. There was no Ezio video to publish on Friday if I didn't finish one
during the week.

My routine used to be to record footage of an evening or a weekend, then edit
things together during working hours. This gives a longer feedback cycle
between capture and knowing if the footage was usable. I could play through
two chapters' worth of content but then have to go right back and start again
because of a problem or dissatisfaction with the result. The need for small
[pick-ups][pu] would cause me endless headaches of having to juggle game saves.

Having the PS4 in my study reduces that cycle to almost nothing. I can capture
a segment, then immediately review it, and rerecord it if necessary, without
having pushed much father ahead. And in Assassin's Creed, this is very
advantageous as it has a much less friendly automatic save. Once I've played a
segment, I cannot return to it. I had to start [archiving the saves][saves]
in order to be able to go back if needed.

So, partly because of the increased speed of feedback, and partly out of
my enthusiasm for making these videos returning, during the week I recorded,
edited, and polished two whole videos, and have all but the music track done
for a third. So I well and truly ticked off my increase buffer goal.

Hopefully one out of three isn't bad, especially as it was a bank holiday
week.
