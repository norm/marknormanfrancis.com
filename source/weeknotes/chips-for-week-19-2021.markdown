Another week, and I’m still [stacking chips][chips]. Last week’s
[chips][markers] looked like this:

[chips]: /2020/06/19/my-week-in-poker-chips
[markers]: /2020/08/22/my-weekchips-markers

## Intention

At the start of the week, I wrote down these high level goals:

1. Get ready for Eurovision — ❌
1. Increase Ezio content buffer — ✅


## Update

Despite this year's Eurovision being only two weeks away, I found I
just could not concentrate on any of the things I wanted to do for
it, barely even get started.

But I could deal with video editing. Even while it can be quite
frustrating at times, it still seems a little meditative to me. So I
recorded, put together, and finished two more Ezio videos. My buffer
now runs into mid-June, so that is truly ticked off.

I then spent several days quite ill, which is why this is a day
later than usual. My Covid-19 test came back negative, so it's
probably not that, but I don't know what it is. Regardless, I am
still not exactly 100% and don't feel like writing more.
