Another week, and I’m still [stacking chips][chips]. Last week’s
[chips][markers] looked like this:

[markers]: /2020/08/22/my-weekchips-markers

Okay, not so much stacking as placing, I didn't do the chips this week. So
instead I have summed up my week. I did a lot of tidying, a lot of not doing
anything notable, and a little bit of coding.

My intention for this week was to have a break. I've been ([mostly][m])
actively on my side projects for more than three months now. And I work longer
hours on those that I would on paid work. On a weekday, I'm up at 5, at my
computer by 5.30, and finish around 4.30–5pm. So with an hour for breakfast
and an hour for lunch, that's nine hours times five days. Weekends, I'm still
sat infront of this computer from 5.30 through 10.30–11am, another eight to
ten hours.

I'm quite relaxed about it. As I've [written before][w13], I don't punish
myself when I can't or won't concentrate. I'll happily take a couple of hours
to make myself a [playlist of James Bond music][bond]. I'll take a couple of
days and just play Factorio. I plan out my week every Monday morning, and then
throw that plan to the wind if I feel like it (I do it mostly to get an idea
of what I *could* get done in the time available).

But even so, it still takes a toll. When I'm planning my annual leave at
work I try to have a break, be it a long weekend or an entire week, every
quarter. So, that's what I did here. I've had three months of non-stop doing
things and now I'm having a break.

A break in which I still [upgraded Pillow][pil] on my GIFs site code, made the
[font handling better][font], added [some new GIFs][z1] to be published later
in the year, and wrote a trie implementation to help me
[spend less money][cfi] on CloudFront invalidations in Flourish.

It seems I just can't help myself.
