Another week, and I’m still [stacking chips][chips]. Last week’s
[chips][markers] looked like this:

## Intention

At the start of the week, I wrote down these high level goals:

1. Fix partial generation in Flourish — ✅
1. Another Ezio chapter — ❌
1. Finish restoring old content into site — ❌
1. Improve site navigation — ❌
1. More Eurovision data — ❌

I only did one of those.


## Update

Recently I discovered a bug in Flourish. It should be possible to generate a
subset of a site with a command like `flourish generate /2021/?`, with the
question mark being a wildcard. On this site as it stands today, that should
generate 277 pages, but it was generating less than 10. I budgeted most of
Monday to fix this, figuring it might be hard to track down what was wrong. I
had it wrapped up and committed before lunch. I spent the rest of Monday
recording many hours of game footage to assemble into the next two Ezio
chapters.

Unfortunately, when I loaded it up into Davinci Resolve Tuesday, it was all
unusable.

Until now, I've been recording this footage on an old (circa 2012) laptop,
using a cheap (£15) USB capture device. It has occasionally caused problems,
most commonly being a strange audio echo. A quick reboot fixes this, and I got
into the habit of recording a few seconds and playing it back before a
recording session to ensure that wasn't happening.

But towards the end of recording Horizon Zero Dawn I had a couple of times
where the audio and video would just slide in and out of sync. It was on some
extra footage outside of the main storyline and only happened briefly so I
didn't bother rerecording it. As usual I turned the laptop off and on again,
and it didn't reoccur. Until now. Except now, even if I restart the laptop,
the problem comes back almost instantly. So now my PS4 is up in my study, and
hooked up to my newer, much more powerful iMac with a new (although still
cheap) video capture device.

As the chips illustrate, I spent most of the rest of the week not doing
anything in my study. Our smol cat [Itsy][itsy] stopped eating anything,
including treats, wasn't drinking, and was listless and acting uncomfortable.
So she went off to the vet where she stayed overnight to get fluids and for
them to monitor her temperature. She's back home now with a course of
antibiotics and an appetite stimulant, and seems mostly okay. But that extra
worry made it hard to concentrate or motivate myself.

I spent the rest of the week achieving nothing, occasionally doing something
with recovered old site content, occasionally just staring at the computer,
occasionally playing Factorio.
