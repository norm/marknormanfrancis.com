Another week of working on "fun" projects.

## My bookmarking app `evocation`

Continuing on from last week, I fixed a couple of niggles, added better behaviour for adding new bookmarks with just the URL, added a differentiation between "production" and "development" (so I could run it for real on my laptop with my actual bookmarks without trashing them whenever I made a change). And, most importantly, made it look like a real thing rather than a bunch of placeholders.

## pubsub-to-slack

As part of getting `evocation` running for reals, I wanted to know when new things were added in the background. I added the [publication of new bookmarks and archives][pub] to [redis pubsub][pubsub]. Then I made a little python script to [republish those into Slack][slack].

This means that I don't have to complicate `evocation` by having it know how to publish to Slack. Also if I think of other things I might want to do when a bookmark is added (eg also tell me via IRC, print it out, update a tally, etc) I don't need to add any more code to `evocation` in order to have that work.

## Setting up `*.dev` on my laptop

When I was working at [GDS][gds] I used [boxen][boxen] to setup my laptop. At my previous job I also used it, but much more half-heartedly. When you're not dealing with the many repositories, software requirements and personal options of a huge organisation, boxen really feels like too much.

Firstly, unless you [tell it otherwise][nope], you get a lot of stuff you may not need. Definitely not in my case.

Secondly, in order to do *anything*, you really need to know [Puppet][puppet]. If you work in a big organisation that uses boxen well (or you [follow one on github][gds-boxen]) then someone has probably done what you want, and you can just use their code. But if you don't or you're doing something new, and you don't know puppet, wellâ€¦ good luck with that. I just don't want to learn an obscure dialect of a tool I otherwise don't use to do something that I consider to be as simple as "run this script".

So I looked for alternatives for automatic OS X laptop setup. And then gave up, and started using ansible instead. I found ansible much more lightweight and easy to learn (although there's a tool built on top of ansible called [battleschool][battleschool] I didn't like how it decided to do things).

I'm writing a little script to set my Mac up how I like, but it's very basic so far. It will rely on roles, so here's two that fulfilled my need for the week, which was to have anything `.dev` resolve to localhost, so I could have my bookmarks on `bookmarks.dev` rather than `localhost:5000`. If I do any more work on the script, I'll write more about it later.
