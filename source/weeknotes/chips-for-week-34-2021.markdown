Another week, and I’m still [stacking chips][chips]. Last week’s
[chips][markers] looked like this:

[chips]: /2020/06/19/my-week-in-poker-chips
[markers]: /2020/08/22/my-weekchips-markers

## Intention

At the start of the week, I wrote down three goals:

1. write up more about hasworn — ❌
1. restart making GIFs — ❌
1. improve hasworn experience — ❌


## Update

As you can probably tell from the number of white chips, very little happened
this week. At the start of the week my gout flared up, which meant I've spent
the week in constant pain.

Constant pain robs me of my ability to think clearly, as do painkillers when
taken in high enough doses. I had only a limited window of concentration
across the week and I had to keep it for the day job, so other than adding
[last week's weeknote][w] the only other thing of note I accomplished was
[adding the applicable dates][d] of weeknotes where I'm using the ISO week
numbering pattern.

(I realised when re-reading the three weeknotes I published on the same day
that I had been relying on the published date to communicate the rough
date for when "week 31" might be, and that did not apply when they are 
published much later.)
