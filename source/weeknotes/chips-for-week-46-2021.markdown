Another week, and I’m still [stacking chips][chips]. Last week’s
[chips][markers] looked like this:

## Intention

At the start of the week, I wrote down one goal:

1. Whatever — ❌


## Update

I'm still having bad headaches, so once again I need to keep all my energy for
work. Not to mention that the longer it continues, the more it robs me of any
drive or impetus to do anything. This week I basically did nothing, apart from
two tiny changes.

For quite a while I was using [Twist][tw] with a team of one to monitor the
outcome of this website's automated overnight rebuilds. But more than once I
have rebooted my iMac and then forgetten to sign back in. Since I wasn't
collaborating with anyone, it didn't even cross my mind. So I would miss
notifications about broken builds. I've decided to end this little flirtation
with Twist, and changed both [this site][ts] and [my GIFs site][gs] to alert
me straight to my phone if a build breaks.
