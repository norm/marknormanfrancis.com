A *weeknote* is a weekly checkin of activity. Matt Webb has written about
their [history and why he writes them][mw]. I try to write them for one of two
reasons: when I'm in work, it reminds me to continue doing work on my personal
projects, even when [I feel there's too much to do][w0]; when I'm out of work,
it helps to measure the passing of time.

The *poker chips* were a lightweight method of measuring my time 
[I started in 2020][wc] as a response to the timelessness of the
COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. The [different colours are meaningful][ch].
