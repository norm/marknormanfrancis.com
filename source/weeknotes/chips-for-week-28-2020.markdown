Another week, another [stack of chips](/2020/06/19/my-week-in-poker-chips).
This week’s chips look like this:

A little bit of coding at the weekend, and a couple of days half coding, half doing other things. I changed how [flourish returns its source objects](https://github.com/norm/flourish/pull/23).

Wednesday, I started doing some coding but basically slept the afternoon away after a couple of days of not getting much rest at night.

Thursday I finished off another change to flourish to [completely change how it handles the different page generators](https://github.com/norm/flourish/pull/24).

And today I basically took the day off to play games with [Ryan](https://twitter.com/rnalexander). I lost both games, so I appreciated the feature built into Tabletop Simulator to flip the table.

Mostly good week. I’d just like to be able to sleep beyond 5am. That’d be nice.
