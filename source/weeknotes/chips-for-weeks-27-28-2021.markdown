Another couple of weeks, and I’m still mostly [stacking chips][chips]. Mostly.
The past two weeks can be summed up in one [chip][markers]:

Basically I've been “away from keyboard”.

Had a couple of unmotivated weeks. After taking a week off I couldn't get back
into the rhythm. Then the dishwasher stopped dishwashing, and I threw my back
out doing open heart surgery on the kitchen plumbing trying to pull at the
washing machine. So I spent a couple of days basically resting and taking pain
killers.

Who knew big metal boxes with concrete blocks inside were heavy and difficult
to move?

Then some bad news and some more bad news about not getting either of a
couple of jobs I was quite excited about, left me in a bit of a funk. So I
did very little other than play games and watch TV.

Tried to [get myself started][st] on rebuilding my [tshirt collection
website][hw], but then got a bit bogged down in my understanding of docker. So
I've let myself faff about until I felt ready to get doing something again.
