In the three weeks that have passed since my [last weeknote][w6], still not
much has happened in terms of code.

During week 7, I was still saving all of my typing for use at work, so no more
code. And in weeks 8 and 9 I took some time off from work.


## Actually taking a holiday

Many previous times when I've had a fair chunk of time off (like, more than a
long weekend) I have started by creating a checklist of things I want to get
done. Then at the end of the my holiday I have felt bad about all of the
things I didn't get done. As I said in [week 0][w0], because I want
everything, I end up doing nothing.

This time, I made no list.

Although it was booked as holiday, I also went into it needing recuperation
time. Physically and mentally, I needed not to be using a computer. So, going
along with my goal this year of wiping my slate clean of excess and focusing
on a small goal, I didn't allow myself any expectation that my holiday would
be used for anything other than fun. I would let the wind carry me wherever.

That said, I did spend a day reading the [GNU Make Manual][gmm] and [The GNU
Make Book][gmb]. Make is something I [have declared][declared] should be a
central part of my website generator, so it is clearly worthwhile my knowing
as much as I can about it in advance. Knowing what is possible means I should
be able to make better decisions than just trying looking at Make questions
and answers on Stack Overflow.

The most interesting observation from my reading was that where a Makefile can
include other subordinate Makefiles, it will also treat them as a target if
the file doesn't exist. So I can [use Make to make my Makefiles][yodawg]. That
will come in handy, and is not an approach I've previously considered.


## Encouragement

The other thing I've noticed is that when I've done little or nothing, I won't
write a weeknote. And since I've basically been physically broken from the
first week that I started keeping weeknotes, I've not had much to write about,
and so had little motivation to write.

This morning on my way to work I get a notification from Tweetbot about a
[tweet from my friend Ryan][ryan]. It's not the first time he's done this. He
offered at the start to help, and I asked him to try and keep me honest. He's
been doing a great job. I probably wouldn't have written this without his
tweet because "I have read about Make" didn't seem worth writing to me. But
knowing I had to write something anyway, my mind filled in the blanks during
the day and here we are.

Thinking about it a little more though, I think it works for two reasons:

1.  Ryan is always upbeat. He tells me he is excited for me *to do* something,
    not asks me later why I hadn't. This makes me feel excited too, and so I'm
    much more likely to take the time to write something.

2. I committed to writing on a specific day. If I had said I would post
   updates when I had them, Ryan wouldn't know when to encourage me without
   first asking if I had something to update on. Which would perhaps turn it
   more towards the nagging end of the spectrum.
