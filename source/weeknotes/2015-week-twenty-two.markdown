Yeah, not so much.

In the intervening time, I have done a small bit of work on some personal
code, but nothing towards my actual stated goals for the year. Plus I quit my
job, did [a bit of freelance work][pando] afterwards, and am currently
unemployed.


## Health

My arm did not get better anywhere near as quickly as I was hoping, but it is
much, much better. I've finished my rehab physiotherapy now, and have one more
appointment with my manual treatment physiotherapist.

Amusingly, it turned out I had tennis elbow as well as trapped nerves and a
dislocated tendon. Hilarious!

## Eurovision

Several years back my wife and I started properly playing Eurovision drinking
games along with the show. Last year I decided to be less passive in my
enjoyment of twitter during the event. I wrote a little perl app to help me
tweet during the event.

This year, I wrote [a little django app][eurodrink] that also helps me keep
[the website][eddotcom] up to date with any new rules and copy changes without
manual editing. I also took the opportunity to move the website to being
hosted on S3 instead of a server (it's only 12 files, it costs me practically
nothing).


## Indie Web Camp

The past two days I spent at [Indie Web Camp Brighton][iwcb].

Saturday was discussions, so I did some talking and thinking about static
websites and getting started, and being reminded how hard this is for people
who aren't programmers.

Sunday was the hacking day, and I spent the day [writing a little python][igb]
that grabs a copy of every photo and video I've [posted to Instagram][ig] so I
can then have a backup and host it on my own site in the future. In Indie Web
terms this is known as [PESOS][pesos]. But I really don't like such forced
acronyms, so I prefer to think of it as [pulled][pull] content.
