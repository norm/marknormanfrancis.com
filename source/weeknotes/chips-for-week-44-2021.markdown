Another week, and I’m still [stacking chips][chips]. Last week’s
[chips][markers] looked like this:

[chips]: /2020/06/19/my-week-in-poker-chips
[markers]: /2020/08/22/my-weekchips-markers

## Intention

At the start of the week, I wrote down three goals:

1. More Ted Lasso season 2 GIFs — ✅
1. More Invader Zim GIFs — ✅
1. Start playing with music library metadata format — ❌


## Update

Headaches and migraines kicking off all week, so a lot of my energy got
reserved for work.

A couple of small bug fixes at the start of the week: fixing a small bug in
this site's add tweet workflow to [actually use][tw] the provided subject and
topic (sigh); and correcting [some wording][wo] on hasworn.

Spent the rest of the mornings making GIFs, as I can do that even when not
thinking straight. Made a couple of changes to the new GIF script, to tell me
when I've [not finished making it properly][df] (see, headaches and
migraines), and when I haven't put in any [size reduction][sz]. Added another
episode of Ted Lasso and one of Invader Zim. In a small moment of clarity,
added some [better titles][tl] to the GIFs site (I was a professional web
developer, once).

But I couldn't do anything on the music library as that involved
experimentation, exploring ideas and, well, thinking. Writing new code is
harder than making small changes to old code. So instead I spent the weekend
doing some chores, putting up a few more of the hexagons, and tidying my desk.
