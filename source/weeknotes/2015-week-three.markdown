This week I haven't spent any time on either my code or my book content as my arm is substantially worse and any typing more than a few minutes at a time is impossible.

However, I have seen my GP and so have painkillers (yay) and I have an appointment at the [Fortius Clinic][fort] to see a specialist to start me on the road to recovery (double yay).
