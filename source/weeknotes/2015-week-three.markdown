This week I haven't spent any time on either my code or my book content as my
arm is substantially worse and any typing more than a few minutes at a time is
impossible.

However, I have seen my GP and so have painkillers (yay) and I have an
appointment at the [Fortius Clinic][fc] to see a specialist to start me on the
road to recovery (double yay).
