This week I haven't spent any time on either my code or my book content as my
arm is still bad and any typing more than a few minutes at a time is
impossible.

However, I did get an examination, which lead to a diagnosis of both a trapped
nerve and a dislocation in my left shoulder. The next day I had both an MRI
and an ultrasound directed injection of steroids. And as a claustrophobic
scared of needles, that was a fun day, let me tell you.

On the other hand, I am grateful that I get to use my private healthcare. My
GP indicated that an MRI would be at least a month away, if not two. So being
diagnosed, scanned, and then treated within a week is rather nice.
