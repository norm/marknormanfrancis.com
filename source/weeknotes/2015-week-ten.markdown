In this past week I've started undergoing regular physiotherapy for my trapped
nerves and documenting a bunch of things in my current job. So, whilst I've
needed to be doing more typing, I've also been in worse pain again. This, plus
other Real Life Thingsâ„¢ means I've not had any time or inclination to spend
more time at a computer when I'm not at work.

In other news, this current week (11) is my last week at my current job, so I
might well have more time to spend on my software and blogging soon. But more
on that later.
