Another few weeks, and Iâ€™m still mostly [stacking chips][chips]. Mostly.
The past four weeks can be summed up in one [chip][markers]:

A dear friend of mine died from cancer and other than a few things to try and
distract myself I've really not been in the mood for much, just helping the
family out where I could be of use. I didn't schedule myself anything, other
than [attending the funeral][f]. Didn't write up weeknotes. Didn't fix my site
when [the automatic content updates broke][b].

In the past three weeks I have basically created a few more GIFs as it is
the perfect way to distract my brain without having to really pay much
attention or think in depth. The only real code update was to give myself
a better way of [choosing spot colours][c] when the automatic palette choice
washes them out or omits them entirely, which I needed for a couple of the
[WarGames GIFs][w] that switch between [blue text and Matthew Broderick][e].

Today, though, I cleared my planning board and added some stuff to do this
week. Let's see if I manage it.
