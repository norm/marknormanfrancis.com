Another week, another [stack of chips](/2020/06/19/my-week-in-poker-chips).
This week looks like this:

<p class='image'><img src='https://mnf.m17s.net/2020/07/03/EcA1IqMWoAEZo_i.jpg' alt=''></p>

Strangely thematic and stratified. A couple of hours at the weekend coding
meant a couple extra chips at the bottom. Monday all coding. Tuesday was a
write-off of nervous energy building to a phone interview that went nowhere
(“making an offer to someone else already”).

Then Wednesday through Friday was coding with one break to sleep in on
Thursday, and Friday afternoon off to play socially distanced board games with
[Ryan](https://twitter.com/rnalexander). And I’ll wrap it up with a fry-up and
Hamilton on Disney+. 4/5ths of a good week.
