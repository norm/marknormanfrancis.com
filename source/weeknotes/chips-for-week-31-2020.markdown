Another week, another [stack of chips](/2020/06/19/my-week-in-poker-chips).
This week’s chips look like this:

As you can see, some solid coding at the start of the week. As I said last week, I made a script to create GIFs from a config file on the command line. I improved it, and wrapped it into the source for [my GIFs site](http://gifs.cackhanded.net) which I redid this week.

Particular highlights for me (beyond now being able to make a gif in a couple of minutes) are being able to change or add something and [just type `make` to get the gif](https://github.com/norm/gifs.cackhanded.net/commit/5ad8aff2cd33a60d9d964d35baa9cf00a5f32013).

I run make in a loop when I’m tweaking the sub-second timing  of captions and so can just save the file, wait a second and hit refresh in Safari. Honestly, half the time I spent on a gif now is writing and rewriting the description that goes on the page.

And since I already have make in the loop, I can use it to [sync the gifs](https://github.com/norm/gifs.cackhanded.net/commit/10b62716ba41d3a8693d7d43eaeaec83f05bdf30) I make to the frankly superb [GIFwrapped](https://gifwrapped.co) so they’re also on my phone.

So, after remaking the site I then spent the last two days of the week playing some board games with [Ryan](https://twitter.com/rnalexander), avoiding my study once the sun hits the west, and just adding more gifs. There’s a lot of [Lilo &amp; Stitch](http://gifs.cackhanded.net/lilo-and-stitch/) there now. Next up, the weekend!
