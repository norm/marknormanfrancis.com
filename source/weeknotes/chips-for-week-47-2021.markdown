Another week, and I’m still [stacking chips][chips]. Last week’s
[chips][markers] looked like this:

[chips]: /2020/06/19/my-week-in-poker-chips
[markers]: /2020/08/22/my-weekchips-markers

## Intention

At the start of the week, I wrote down one goal:

1. Some small updates to the site — ❌


## Update

Apart from day-job work, having occasional headaches, and watching a bunch of
TV, I achieved nothing this week. Zero attention and energy.
