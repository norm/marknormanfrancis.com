Another week, and I’m still [stacking chips][chips]. Last week’s
[chips][markers] looked like this:

## Intention

At the start of the week, I wrote down two goals:

1. Rebuild hasworn so it is easily updated — ⏩
1. Get back to gaming videos — ❌


## Update

The week started with a continuation of the not-getting-much-done from the
[previous weeks][pw]. I would sit in front of the computer, and then a whole
world of `#nope` would descend over me. I couldn't even bring myself to write
and publish the weeknotes on Monday.

Something clicked inside me on the Wednesday morning though (and boy, do I
wish I knew what/how so I could harness that for next time I'm in a funk).
I wrote up the [weeknotes][pw], and started working away.

As the top of the stack of chips will show, though, it was still a quieter
week for activity. Amongst the coding are still stripes of `#nope` where I
would just sit and stare. Or watch YouTube. Or play games. Still, a little is
better than nothing.

By the end of the week I had [hasworn][hw] in a position where I could push
code to GitHub and it would build a Docker image, deploy it, and restart
the new application without a service interruption. I'll continue improving
that next week.

My other goal was to get back into the habit of making and publishing gaming
videos. Whilst I had been playing games, they weren't Assassin's Creed, they
were only for my own fun. I can't seem to get myself back into the right space
yet.
