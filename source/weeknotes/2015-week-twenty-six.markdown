Another week of working on "fun" projects.

## battleschool

I changed my mind about using [battleschool] to set things up on my laptop, so I spent some of the week configuring that for myself. The change of heart came around because it has built-in support for installing software to `/Applications`. I was originally thinking of using [homebrew-cask][cask] to install things, but I hadn't used it before. I found it installs apps somewhere else, then symlinks them to `/Applications` (well, actually it first symlinks to `~/Applications` but you can override that). Unfortunately for me, I am hard-wired now to switch apps with the keyboard (I use [LaunchBar]) and it didn't see the symlinks as apps. There's probably something I could've done to make it work, but I tried battleschool again and had my first app installed in a couple of minutes. Sold.

I've got a good start now on ansible playbooks that set up my laptop the way I like, which I'll be tidying up and publishing to GitHub once I work out how to properly arrange them.

## More `evocation` work

I added some more niceties to [evocation], including:

* listing all archives of a bookmark, not just the most recent
* button to take a new archive
* button to delete the bookmark
* fetch new bookmarks from Pinboard automatically
* push bookmarks added in `evocation` to Pinboard

and fixed a few more bugs and niggles.

## Health

I also spent a couple of days not doing much because I had a bad gout attack and felt very sorry for myself (even though it was entirely my own fault for drinking more soda than I normally do to see if it would bring on an attackâ€¦ which it did).
