I skipped Week 5. I said at the end of [Week 4][w4] that I'd just had an MRI
and a steroid injection. The leaflet that came with the injection said that
25% of recipients will experience pain as a result. I "won" that lottery, and
then some. For a week I was in much more pain than when I
[broke my elbow][elbow] and any patience I had for using computers was all
used up at work (and on several days I just stayed at home feeling sorry for
myself, especially when you add a cough and cold to the mixture).

I still don't have any code to show yet, as I'm still only just on the mend.
But I do have an observation.

Some time around 2010 my personal projects went from being interesting and fun to being laborious. A millstone around my neck. I would sporadically work on some, not all. I kept on coming up with new ideas, and those were exciting. However, once I started writing any code for them, they quickly morphed into another dull, lifeless chore for me to ignore.

As I'm getting back to the point where I can start typing for extended periods (which is really "anything more than 5 minutes at a time" right now), I'm getting excited. Excited to start exploring [go][go] further, excited to start writing more, and excited to be solving a problem.

I can't remember the last time working on a personal project (and, unfortunately, this does include the last couple of [forts][df]) was truly exciting. I am itching to get back to working on [flourish][fl]. I have to keep reminding myself to rest and recuperate, so I don't prolong my condition.
