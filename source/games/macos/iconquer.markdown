I’ve always been a big player of games. Ever since I can remember the holidays
would involve me playing a lot of [Monopoly][mn], [Cluedo][cl] or some other
board game. Then later, I discovered arcade games. I put loads of money into
games such as [Green Beret][gb], [Elevator Action][ea] and [Mr. Do!][do].

Sometime after that, I saved up lots of money and bought myself a [home
computer][speccy]. I played so many games on that, I broke the keyboard.

However, even in the modern day with [vast, twisting plots][mgs],
[beautifully realised 3D environments][trl] and [truly terrifying][sh] action
I still yearn to play board games.

The downside is that most people I am friends with are not based in my part of
the world. This means I very rarely get to play board games. So, sometimes I
play them in computer form.

Friday afternoon, I ran across a link to a game called [iConquer][ic]. I
grabbed a copy and played it that evening. The evaluation copy allows you to
play it ten times before you have to pay for it. I stumped up my cash within
the hour, I couldn’t stop playing it.

The maps and plugins are all very clever, and not having to roll dice over and
over and over and over is just a blessed relief. The computer AI is okay, if
not wonderful. It can make for a challenging game at times, but mostly it’s
just a matter of time. Either that, or I am a great Risk gamer. Hmm. Anyway,
it’s also possible to play over a network or the internet if you’d like to
play against some other humans.

In summary, I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the board
game Risk, and fancies plaing a quick game on their computer or with people
who aren’t anywhere nearby.
