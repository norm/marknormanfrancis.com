I’ve always been a big player of games. Ever since I can remember the holidays would involve me playing a lot of [Monopoly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_%28game%29), [Cluedo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo) or some other board game. Then later, I discovered arcade games. I put loads of money into games such as [Green Beret](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush%27n_Attack), [Elevator Action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_Action) and [Mr. Do!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Do).


Sometime after that, I saved up lots of money and bought myself a [home computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zx_spectrum). I played so many games on that, I broke the keyboard.


However, even in the modern day with [vast, twisting plots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_gear_solid), [beautifully realised 3D environments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider_Legend) and [truly terrifying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill_%28video_game%29) action I still yearn to play board games.


The downside is that most people I am friends with are not based in my part of the world. This means I very rarely get to play board games. So, sometimes I play them in computer form.


Friday afternoon, I ran across a link to a game called [iConquer](http://www.kavasoft.com/iConquer/index.php). I grabbed a copy and played it that evening. The evaluation copy allows you to play it ten times before you have to pay for it. I stumped up my cash within the hour, I couldn’t stop playing it.


The maps and plugins are all very clever, and not having to roll dice over and over and over and over is just a blessed relief. The computer AI is okay, if not wonderful. It can make for a challenging game at times, but mostly it’s just a matter of time. Either that, or I am a great Risk gamer. Hmm. Anyway, it’s also possible to play over a network or the internet if you’d like to play against some other humans.


In summary, I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the board game Risk, and fancies plaing a quick game on their computer or with people who aren’t anywhere nearby.
