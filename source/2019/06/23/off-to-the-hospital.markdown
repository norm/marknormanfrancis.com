Off to the hospital to play kidney stone, appendicitis, or hernia.If you chose appendix, the doctors agreed with you. I was kept in for an appendectomy.However, they were wrong. Still have my appendix, and now they think it’s diverticulitis.After an elevated temperature, so many injections, many drugs (including morphine, mmm) I’ve apparently passed my blood tests and should be released. And then have a follow-up colonoscopy in a few weeks.Only had to take 150mg of codeine today so I must be fine now.
