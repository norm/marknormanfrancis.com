Many moons ago, I had a wonderful mobile phone, the [Nokia 7650][7650]. I
loved that phone. But one day I stepped on it. I’ve been through two other
phones since then, but I’ve always had fond memories of my 7650. Then, late
last year, I read details of a new phone from Nokia which was highly
reminiscent of my beloved 7650.

## Nokia N80

The [Nokia N80][n80] is a third generation Series 60 product, with all of the common
mobile phone extras, plus a thre megapixel camera and wi-fi.

### The positives

* The phone’s screen is absolutely to die for. It is the same physical size as
  most phones, but at twice the resolution. Vector graphics are used in many
  places and the anti-aliased fonts are clear and easy to read.
* A common complaint levelled at phones such as the N70 is their slowness.
  When using the N80 however, the OS feels fast and more than responsive
  enough to not be frustrating.
* The new ‘active standby’ feature which uses the home screen to display
  upcoming calendar events and todos is lovely, as is being able to define
  your six most frequently used apps for quick access.


### The negatives

* With a smaller that normal battery, rated at only 750mAh the device lasts
  less than two days on standby. However, this may be due to the fact I leave
  Bluetooth on all the time.
* Nokia have also changed the power charger’s plug on this phone. So the eight
  other chargers I have are now redundant. And it’s not like there’s not
  enough room in the base for a physically bigger plug. Smacks of change for
  change’s sake to me.
* Whilst the camera is going to be fine for quick snaps, ([some reference
  pictures][rp]) it’ll not be replacing my Casio Exilim. It’ll mainly be used
  where I don’t have my camera or I can’t be bothered digging into my bag for
  it.
* So far, setting up the wi-fi correctly has confounded me. The manual refers
  to an application I can’t find &mdash; this may be my incompetence, or it
  could be because Orange like changing things around on their phone setups.
  Apparently, however, wi-fi drains the already-too-short battery life.
* Older Series 60 software cannot be installed, so the library of mobile
  software I’d built up is now useless to me.


### Summary

Despite the number of negatives points there are about this phone, on the
whole I love it. Most negatives are niggles to me rather than a cause to smash
the phone into tiny pieces from frustration. Thoroughly recommended.
