Last Thursday night you would have found me giving one third of
[a talk on microformats to the Web Standards Group in London][uf].

I was up first, giving a quick walk through the history of microformats, and
comparing the semantic web (lowercase s, lowercase w) that these create to the
Semantic Web (uppercase S, uppercase W) initiative from the W3C. I illustrated
the flaws in the most common argument against microformats (XML namespaces)
and highlighted the rapid adoption of microformats in the real world in the
year-and-a- bit since the launch.

Then [Jeremy Keith][jk] delved into the semantics used in marking up
microformats, and on developing a nose for content that can be marked up and
shared.

And lastly [Drew McLellan][dm] in a presentation dramatically entitled “Can
your website be your API?” talked about how a site using microformats could be
used to implement an API for some forms of information about an individual.

After the talks, there was time for a bit of Q&A, and then we retired to the
[usual gaff][pub] of [Pub Standards][ps] for beer and more conversation.
