New socks, to extend my range of interesting colours. Sadly [`@marksandspencer`](https://twitter.com/marksandspencer) still feel the need to offset fun colours with an abundance of dark and boring blue. I don’t want more blue. I have enough blue. Because I’ve bought multicoloured packs before AND THEY ALWAYS HAVE BLUE.
