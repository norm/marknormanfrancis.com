Although I suspect I won’t like this month’s [`@whisky_me_`](https://twitter.com/whisky_me_) whisky, I love the little flavour icons on the sticker.

For years I didn’t think I liked whisky. Until (thanks to [`@rnalexander`](https://twitter.com/rnalexander)) I tried a non-peated whisky made into an old fashioned.

And even if I don’t like this month’s whisky, I am still a fan of [`@whisky_me_`](https://twitter.com/whisky_me_) for introducing me to Macallan 12y fine oak. Now I have a favourite whisky that’s still in production again.

My previous favourite was this puppy, which was stopped and replaced with something somewhat unpleasant. And now I have less than half a bottle left, for special occasions only.
