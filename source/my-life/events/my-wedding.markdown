On Friday, I got married to a girl I’ve been with for around about a decade.
And like all good geeks, we put a few references to popular culture into the
event.

The first, and most obvious, was a little bit of Pirate. After all, the
wedding was on September 19, which is also
[International Talk Like A Pirate Day][itlap]. Beforehand, a few people had
asked me how much piratical influence there would be on the day. Only Jeremy
Keith [correctly nailed it][jkt] that my speech would contain pirate speak.
Most people were focused upon the ceremony.


## My speech

Index cards are often used by people to remind them what they need to say in
their speeches. I put my notes on my iPhone. This is the early draft—what I
said on the day was the same in structure, but with a bit more ad-libbing and
a little bit of forgetting to say a couple of things.

## Musical references

Despite a lack of piratical influence upon the ceremony, there was still a
couple of extras in there for anyone paying attention. To start with, we made
up a special playlist of some modern classical music to pass the time while
everyone waited for the bride to turn up, with the last song reserved to play
only as she walked down the aisle.

## Popular culture

And lastly, during the ceremony itself, after being declared as legally
married by law, SJ leaned in to me and whispered [You’re my wife now!][pl]
