Thursday night was [Substandards Ben][ben].


Amongst the celebrations of birthdays, continental relocations, and general
beer drinking, [one guy][da] left early, abandoning his beer. On the floor,
against the wall. Which I managed to spill, also onto the floor. Turns out
that metal flooring (through which pubs get deliveries) plus beer is slippery.
Too slippery for my Pumas.

My feet went out from under me when I lent back. I put my arm out to try and
catch my fall, and took my entire landing through my left arm. Which was
perfectly straight.

Chances are, when this happens you will break your wrist, elbow or shoulder.
Or so the doctor told me the next day, when I was looking at the x-ray of my
[broken elbow][be].
