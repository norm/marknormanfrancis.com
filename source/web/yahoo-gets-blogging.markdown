For many years now, I've had no real website to speak of. Just some little
test pages for silly things I wanted to try. Or one of many failed attempts to
get off my arse and start writing a blog. In fact, the last site I did for
myself that was in any way supposed to be seen by others was from 1997.

Perhaps you find that bizarre, considering it's what I do for a living.
Perhaps not. I feel it's like the dentist who has bad teeth. I do websites all
day long at work, the last thing I want to do is come home and start doing
more websites.

For a while I was <del>unemployed</del> freelancing. A perfect time to work on a
personal site, you might think. However, during this period I still worked on
sites for others, and although I had a lot of time to myself, I lacked focus
and a goal.

I find I've never been able to get things done if I don't have a deadline. I
spend ages on stupid, fiddly, pointless detail. I think about things a lot
without actually doing anything. Then forget my conclusions and have to think
about them again. I procrastinate terribly, and find many and varied things to
do that aren't what I feel I ought to do, but that seem more fun or more
relevant at the time.

And plus, for a long time, I had **not the first clue** what the hell to write
about. Other than myself and my life, there's nothing that I could be classed
as an expert at. I'm a pretty smart web developer, but am I an
[Eric Meyer][em] or a [Jeffrey Zeldman][jz]? Don't be silly.


## Why start now?

Then, this year, two big things happened. Firstly, I went to
[@media 2005][at]. I met a lot of people there that were bloggers I'd heard of
(and many I hadn't). And also a handful of people that I had respect for,
thought of as gurus and leaders in the field. And I discovered something
important. They're sometimes just as lost, just as clueless and on the same
search for answers that I am.

(Also, I discovered that this is a cool bunch of people to hang out with â€”
especially on the way up to closing time, and then on into the small hours.)

But secondly, I discovered I occasionally had something to say. I'd find
myself sitting at my desk at work, reading something and point it out to a
colleague. Then end up discussing it. Sometimes forcefully. Perhaps too
forcefully (I have a tendency to rant, and often don't realise that I'm doing
it). I thought to myself that it might be better if I channelled that into a
blog.


## Working for Yahoo!

With the gears of decision grinding away in my head, I start looking into the
idea of blogging about Yahoo! Now, there are obviously many big names that
work for the company that blog. And they all seem to be based in the United
States. Hmm. I tried to find someone more European, but failed. So I asked
around. And a lot of people thought the idea of blogging would be much at odds
with the P.R. department's view of the world. Despite the existence of the
[official Yahoo! employee blog guidelines][bg].

So, I shelved the idea of talking about Yahoo! This pretty much also dried up
my enthusiasm as well. It's a damn big part of my involvement with the web,
after all.

But then, [Simon Willison][sw] joined us. Now, technically, he works for the
US, on [flickr][fl]. But he's still in the UK for a while. And still blogging.
Hmm, again.

So I get a renewed sense of optimism, and start building my site. I write a
couple of example posts, and show them to my boss. One has the promise of
being linked to (on the internet, who'da thunk it?) He tells me it'd probably
be best to run it past PR, just incase. I get a name from my department head
and contact her about my blog. She asks to meet up about it. Ah, crap.

But then, I do. And basically have an informal chat about it. Actually, she
seemed interested in what I do and might write about. I realised, I'm being
**encouraged** to start blogging about Yahoo! Obviously, not breaking my NDA
and such, but otherwise, hey, feel free. Asked if there's anything she can do
to **help** me. Wow.

Yahoo! gets blogging. I don't know why it's a surprise to me. Actually maybe I
should rephrase that. Yahoo! Europe gets it **too**. I love working for this
company sometimes.
