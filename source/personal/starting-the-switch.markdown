When I was studying at university, I mostly used Unix, specifically SunOS. I
became very familiar and comfortable with it (so much so that I tried running
something called [MiNT][m] on my Atari ST, to simulate the environment). There
were some PCs around at the time, but they were only running DOS.

Later, I started work in support, and had to learn how to use Windows 3.1.
However, I stayed with Unix on my desktop. Even later, Windows 95 came out,
and I started the process of moving my desktop to it.

I mention this because to Microsoft fans I am a Unix nerd. To hardcore Unix
users, I am a Windows weenie. But I've never been in an
[uncomfortable position][u] over my choice of operating system. I believe in
using the right tool for the job, and for a long time, I never thought that
there was a serious competitor to the Windows desktop in the Unix environment.
For all of the hard work that has been done on systems like [KDE][k] and
[GNOME][g], they still feel like layers over [X11][x], and that's the basic
problem — X11 never evolved.

Now, the astute readers will notice that I haven't mentioned the Mac OS. I
never had a chance to use it in anger until after OS X was released. And I was
intrigued by it. Unix? With a decent UI? But then I never had a chance to do
more than play with it. And I could never afford to throw money at Apple to
buy a computer off of them, until I was really sure that I would actually use
it.

So for a few years, I stuck to home-built boxes running [NetBSD][n] and
Windows. And coveted the idea of having OS X. Then the Mac Mini was launched,
and I immediately bought one, since it seemed churlish not to. It was cheap
enough to buy without worrying about the idea of it being a useless purchase.
I quickly realised I wanted to use OS X exclusively and had to invest in some
more serious, and portable, hardware. That Mini went to my mother.

Now, finally, my [employer][y] is getting me a nice, shiny PowerBook. I face a
fundamental change in my desktop environment, not just augmenting it with a
second OS. This fills me with excitement, but also trepidation. Excitement,
because I can use seriously cool software such as [Quicksilver][q].
Trepidation because I have an **army** of utilities and a decade of
familiarity to replace.

I'm not joking, either. Probably because of my Unix background — and
inveterate need to fiddle — I cannot use a stock Windows installation. I have
a collection of utilities, registry changes and scripts that absolutely must
be installed on the machine before I can think of doing anything. And this is
not covering actual full applications that I use every day: TopStyle,
Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, Mozilla Firefox, et cetera. No, I'm
referring to programs that allow me to right-click on a program's titlebar and
have it drop to the bottom of the z-order, automatic sizing of windows, being
able to press the Windows-W key combo and have the URL in my clipboard open in
my browser without bringing it to the front.

Not that I mind. It gives me a proper excuse to clean out my collections of
random stuff that accumulates, learn how to work more effectively by breaking
bad habits, and hell, just have **fun** with my computer for a while. OS X?
Bring it on.
