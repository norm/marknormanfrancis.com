On Tuesday we had a new member of the web development team. You may have heard of him. You should certainly know of one of his affiliations. [Drew McLellan](http://allinthehead.com), the Strategy Lead for the [Web Standards Project](http://webstandards.org/).


As [he writes](http://allinthehead.com/retro/297/joining-yahoo), he finds it difficult to understand why there is some criticism over such a move. I can’t understand it myself, but then I wasn’t an internet famous blogger or web developer when I started here. I was just a code monkey who had played around with CSS in his spare time.


In a recent [podcast for the run-up to d.Construct](http://2006.dconstruct.org/podcast/) [Jeremy Keith](http://adactio.com) accused me of being brainwashed because I like where I work, and think it’s exciting. He was probably being less than serious in his own inimitable deadpan way. But then, there is many a true word spoken in jest.


I interviewed for Yahoo! back in June 2004, for a position in the User Experience Design department as the second dedicated web developer in the team. Well, technically the third, as [Murray Rowan](http://flickr.com/photos/ptg/169488376/) had been there for years, but his job had been creating tools for web site building and a focus on accessibility.


Since then, I’ve watched the team grow from four web development people to nearly twenty, with more to come soon. And each and every one I would consider to be of a world-class standard. Frankly, I doubt you could get past our extensive interview process without being more than competent at developing sites with web standards.


(Speaking of the interview process, I was the person who gave Drew our technical tests. I found it rather amusing to ask him “So, what benefits do you see when building sites using web standards?” and to press him for an answer as well.)


A lot of the people who have joined us have expressed similar sentiments to Drew’s: I get to work somewhere where I don’t have to fight for best practises. That being with others who think the same way inspires and excites.


From my perspective, working at Yahoo! Europe is incomparable, for a developer in the UK. Where else do I get to work on sites with millions of visitors, where web standards are de rigeur, where considering performance, reusability, internationalisation, sharing and education is (excuse the pun) the norm?
