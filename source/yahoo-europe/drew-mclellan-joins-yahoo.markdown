On Tuesday we had a new member of the web development team. You may have heard
of him. You should certainly know of one of his affiliations. [Drew
McLellan][dm], the Strategy Lead for the [Web Standards Project][wasp].

As [he writes][jy], he finds it difficult to understand why there is some
criticism over such a move. I can’t understand it myself, but then I wasn’t an
internet famous blogger or web developer when I started here. I was just a
code monkey who had played around with CSS in his spare time.

In a recent [podcast for the run-up to d.Construct][dc] [Jeremy Keith][jk]
accused me of being brainwashed because I like where I work, and think it’s
exciting. He was probably being less than serious in his own inimitable
deadpan way. But then, there is many a true word spoken in jest.

I interviewed for Yahoo! back in June 2004, for a position in the User
Experience Design department as the second dedicated web developer in the
team. Well, technically the third, as [Murray Rowan][mr] had been there for
years, but his job had been creating tools for web site building and a focus
on accessibility.

Since then, I’ve watched the team grow from four web development people to
nearly twenty, with more to come soon. And each and every one I would consider
to be of a world-class standard. Frankly, I doubt you could get past our
extensive interview process without being more than competent at developing
sites with web standards.

(Speaking of the interview process, I was the person who gave Drew our
technical tests. I found it rather amusing to ask him “So, what benefits do
you see when building sites using web standards?” and to press him for an
answer as well.)

A lot of the people who have joined us have expressed similar sentiments to
Drew’s: I get to work somewhere where I don’t have to fight for best
practises. That being with others who think the same way inspires and excites.

From my perspective, working at Yahoo! Europe is incomparable, for a developer
in the UK. Where else do I get to work on sites with millions of visitors,
where web standards are de rigeur, where considering performance, reusability,
internationalisation, sharing and education is (excuse the pun) the norm?
