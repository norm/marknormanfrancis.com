On Thursday I gave a quick talk on microformats to the assembled hordes of Product Operations in Yahoo! Europe (this department contains project management, web development, design and user research—people who actually build websites).


The basic structure of the talk was:


1. use a couple of quotes taken from the [what are microformats?](http://microformats.org/wiki/what-are-microformats) page, and one from [Jeremy Keith](http://adactio.com/)'s talk [In Praise of the Hyperlink](http://adactio.com/articles/1132/) to introduce the concept


2. quickly describe the [W3C](http://www.w3.org/)'s [Semantic Web](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/) (note capitalisation) vision and progress over the past five years


3. describe the progress made in just over one year by microformats in creating the semantic web (note lower case)


4. note adoption of microformats by some small EU Yahoo! properties and some big US Yahoo! properties


5. briefly name and describe some microformats (without code examples)


6. show how [hCard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard) can be used by the [Technorati](http://technorati.com/) [contacts feed service](http://technorati.com/contacts/) to take the list of [speakers from this year’s d.Construct](http://2006.dconstruct.org/speakers/) and them to my address book


7. show how [hCalendar](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar) can be used by the [Technorati](http://technorati.com/) [events feed service](http://technorati.com/events/) to take the [schedule from this year’s d.Construct](http://2006.dconstruct.org/schedule/) and add it to my calendar


8. take questions from the audience




*End result*—a few more people at Yahoo! Europe understand exactly what microformats are and why I consider them important; a handful are now excited enough to go learn more (and not just in the web development team); and I should learn to save my [Keynote](http://www.apple.com/keynote) files before rebooting my machine.
