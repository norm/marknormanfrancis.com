I’m quite late on writing about the 2006 @media conference. Some people
[covered][ph] [it][sc] [live][cl] and other people [posted][jk]
[extensive][mp] [reviews][bw]. And to top it all, [Gareth Rushgrove][gr]
<del>is</del><ins>was</ins> doing a bang-up job of collecting <del>everything
@media 2006</del> \[ed: link no longer works\].

So, I thought I’d write what I found most useful. I had hoped that that would
be the design panels, since I already know CSS pretty much inside and out and
JS pretty well. As a person with seemingly no design sensibilities I thought
it might be enlightening to hear [Jon Hicks][jh], [Veerle Pieters][vp] and
[Cameron Moll][cm] talk about great design. In the end I thought a lot of it
was great information, if you already understood design or even had some
creative leanings. I didn’t get much out of it except a greater appreciation
of the point of carefully thought-out typography; and finding some amusement
watching [Simon][sw] fire up OmniGraffle to start [drawing squirrels][sq].

I also found [Andy Clarke][ac]'s [presentation][tc] quite thought-provoking
and worthwhile, in terms of getting inspiration for design (and semantic
structure?!?) in the world around us, rather than in just copying other sites
we like the look of.

But by far the most resonant thing was a single comment made in the Javascript
libraries panel, I think from [Stuart Langridge][sl] (you’d think if it was
such a great comment, I’d bloody remember who said it, wouldn’t you?). The
comment was that most back-end programmers don’t understand JavaScript,
because in their world there’s never a situation where the server’s programs
just don’t run but the server is still running.

Now (casually ignoring situations where perl hasn’t been installed on a server
so that scripts break, or other such things…) I found this one of those “Of
course, now it’s been said out loud, it’s obvious” moments. I always had this
niggling annoyance with [our][yh] engineers writing inline JS. But it often
seemed like banging your head against a brick wall trying to explain to them
why progressive enhancement is the Right Way To Do It.

I may not be able to get the concept across even now, but at least I have a
new angle of attack to come at them from now.
